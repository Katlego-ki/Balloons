# Balloons
Guess the order of N colours.



## On GitHub
*This is a "backend prototype" of the game and I'm still working on the complete game with UI design and other minor functionalities/additionals.

What about:

1. getinput.close() to avoid "resource leak"?
2. ......
3. Using intellij
    - after each guess, play distinct sounds (ting! for correct and gg! for wrong) with 1 second delay according
      to the order of the attempts.
    - OR after each guess, display black (0) and white (1) baloons for 1 second and clear the screen.
4. Easy (3 baloons), medium (4 baloons), hard (5 baloons)
